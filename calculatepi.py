Assignment:

Write and submit a Python program that computes an approximate value of π by calculating the following sum:

(see: https://github.com/HHS-IntroProgramming/Calculate-Pi/blob/master/README.md)

This sum approaches the true value of π as n approaches ∞.

Your program must ask the user how many terms to use in the estimate of π, the number of significant
figures to show, then print the estimate using the correct number of significant figures. For example:

I will estimate pi. How many terms should I use? 100
How many sig figs should I use in the result? 8
The approximate value of pi is 3.1315929
